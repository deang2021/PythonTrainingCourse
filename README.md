# pythonTraining
This is a repository containing Python coding and training which I completed out-of-hours and after my working day.

This repository includes:
  Working with variables
  User/Agent inputs
  Strings
  If Statements
  Comparison Operators 
  While and For loops
  Functions

and much more..
